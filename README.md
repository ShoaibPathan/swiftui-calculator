# Reflection

I built this app to practice SwiftUI and its layout system. The calculator functions, but in future versions I would love to upgrade this to an order of operations calculator.

Things to do:

* order of operations calculation
* limit character count and remove all ellipses
* large numbers should be displayed in scientific notation and small numbers should be rounded to nth decimal places
