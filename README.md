# swiftui-calculator

A simple calculator app built using SwiftUI.

I built this app to practice SwiftUI and its layout system. The calculator functions and permits operation chaining, but in future versions I would love to upgrade this to an order of operations calculator.

Other things to add:
* order of operations calculation
* limit character count and remove all ellipses
  * large numbers should be displayed in scientific notation and small numbers should be rounded to nth decimal places
